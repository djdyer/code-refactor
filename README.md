# code-refactor

The Horiseon marketing agency has requested a code refactor on their existing homepage code to make it more accessible and efficient. 

By following the Scouts Rule, I have reduced the CSS by 25% by consolidating the selectors and properties within the HTML, adding semantic + alt / title tags to improve accessibility / SEO where possible. 

Both the HTML and CSS scripts are commented and formatted according to best practices.



User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

```


Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
